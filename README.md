## Getting Started

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
yarn
```

Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Environment Variables

I used MovieDB API for this project. In order to use this API, you need to create an account and generate an API KEY. For the project, you need to create .env file and add to your API Key.

```bash
VITE_API_KEY = <YOUR_API_KEY>
```
